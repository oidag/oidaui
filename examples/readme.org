* Regarding examples

I think the best example are ones that satisfy the following:
 
 1. Are easy to compile
 2. Framed to be a good "template" or "bare bones start" to a larger project
 3. Are very well documented as to whats going on down to the smallest
    details

So I encourage you to copy-paste each one of these projects, see if
you can build it and get it to run, and then start to play around with
it and put in some of your own tweaks. This is a good practice to best
understand a library like this.
